# billing-app
Project overview and setup instructions
Step 2: Create Your GitHub Repository (if not done yet)
Go to your GitHub account (https://github.com/spurushothaman419)

Create a new repository named, e.g., embroidery-billing-app

Clone it locally:
git clone https://github.com/spurushothaman419/embroidery-billing-app.git
cd embroidery-billing-app

Step 3: Set Up Backend
Inside your repo folder, create a backend directory:
mkdir backend
cd backend
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Create a requirements.txt file and add:
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
sqlalchemy
fastapi-users[sqlalchemy]
databases[sqlite]
pydantic

Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Run your backend API server locally: uvicorn main:app --reload
Verify the API is running at:http://127.0.0.1:8000

Step 4: Set Up Frontend
Go back to your repo root and create a frontend directory:

cd ..
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend

Install Axios for API calls: npm install axios react-router-dom

Replace the default src/App.js with a starter React app that includes:
Login page calling your backend /auth/jwt/login

Customer list page fetching /customers/

JWT token storage in memory or cookie (for demo) I can provide this React starter code next.

Start React app locally: npm start
Access frontend at http://localhost:3000


What to do next?
Create folders and files exactly as above.

Run backend with:
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Run frontend with:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the customer list page (initially empty).
Use tools like Postman to create users and customers via API to test.

How to run:
Make sure all these files are in your /backend/app/ folder.

Install dependencies (see your requirements.txt): pip install fastapi uvicorn fastapi-users[sqlalchemy] sqlalchemy pydantic passlib[bcrypt] email-validator
Run the app: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Test endpoints: 

POST /auth/register to create users

POST /auth/jwt/login to get JWT token

POST /customers/ with JWT auth to create customers

GET /customers/ with JWT auth to list customers

2. Wireframe Sketches (Basic Screens)
Home / Dashboard
•	Summary: total sales, orders pending, notifications
Login / Signup
•	Username/email + password form
Customer Management
•	List of customers with search, add, edit, delete
Product & Service Catalog
•	List of embroidery services/products with pricing
Order Creation
•	Select customer, add products, quantity, pricing details
•	Show total, tax, discounts
Invoice View
•	Detailed order info with print & PDF export button
Reports
•	Simple charts & tables for sales and payments
________________________________________
I can create these wireframes as:
•	Simple image sketches
•	Figma file (interactive and shareable)
•	Code-based React UI skeleton
________________________________________
Next Step
Would you prefer:
1.	Static image wireframes for quick review?
2.	Interactive Figma wireframes you can modify and share?
3.	Or should I start creating a React UI skeleton for the frontend?
Here’s how we can proceed step-by-step:
________________________________________
1. Project Plan Outline
Phase 1: Requirements & Planning (1-2 days)
•	Finalize features and scope
•	Define user roles and access levels
•	Set up GitHub repo structure
Phase 2: Design & Wireframes (2-3 days)
•	Design UI wireframes for key pages: Dashboard, Customer Management, Product Catalog, Order Entry, Billing & Invoices, Reports, User Settings
•	Review & finalize wireframes
Phase 3: Backend Development (5-7 days)
•	Setup backend with REST API (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI)
•	Implement database schema (customers, products, orders, users)
•	User authentication & role management
•	API endpoints for CRUD operations
Phase 4: Frontend Development (5-7 days)
•	Setup frontend framework (React.js or Vue.js)
•	Build components for pages based on wireframes
•	Integrate with backend API
•	Implement PDF invoice generation
Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (2-3 days)
•	Unit and integration testing
•	Deploy frontend & backend (e.g., Vercel + Render)
•	Setup environment variables, security configs
Phase 6: Enhancements & Integrations (Optional)
•	Email/SMS notifications
•	Export to accounting tools
•	Advanced reporting and analytics
________________________________________
2. Wireframes
I’ll generate basic wireframe sketches for these key pages:
•	Dashboard: Overview of sales, orders, inventory alerts
•	Customer Management: List, add/edit customer
•	Product Catalog: Manage embroidery items & stock
•	Order Entry: Create new order with billing
•	Invoice Viewer: View/download printable invoice
•	Reports: Sales, inventory, payment reports
•	User Settings: Profile and roles
________________________________________
3. Starter Code Setup on GitHub
I can provide:
•	Backend: FastAPI starter with models and CRUD endpoints for customers, products, orders, users
•	Frontend: React starter with pages and API integration skeleton
•	Database: PostgreSQL schema scripts
•	README.md: Setup and run instructions
________________________________________
Next Steps:
•	Please share your GitHub repository URL or tell me if you want me to create a new public repo for you to fork.
•	Let me know your preferred backend language/framework (Node.js or Python/FastAPI).
•	Confirm frontend preference (React.js or Vue.js).
•	Any specific tech or feature preferences?
Once I have this info, I’ll generate the initial project plan doc, wireframes images (or link), and starter repo structure with sample code.
What I’ll do right now:
•	Generate ready-to-use starter code for backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React.js) with secure JWT authentication.
•	Use only free and open-source libraries/tools for security and functionality.
•	Provide clear instructions to run locally right away.
•	Set up a basic but secure foundation you can extend as you build.
________________________________________
Key free open-source libraries included:
Feature	Library / Tool	Purpose
Backend Framework	FastAPI	Modern, fast Python web API
Authentication	fastapi-users (JWT + OAuth2)	Secure user management
Database	SQLite (for starter) / PostgreSQL optional	Lightweight local DB for dev
ORM	SQLModel / SQLAlchemy	Object-relational mapping
Frontend Framework	React.js	Modern UI
HTTP Client	Axios	API calls in React
PDF Generation	jsPDF or pdfmake	Invoice PDF generation
________________________________________
Immediate Starter Package Includes:
•	Backend:
o	User registration/login with JWT auth
o	Customer CRUD API endpoints
o	Input validation and security best practices (CORS, HTTPS headers, etc.)
o	SQLite DB for fast local dev (easy to upgrade later)
•	Frontend:
o	Login and registration pages
o	Protected routes with React Router
o	Customer management UI (list, add, edit) connected to backend API
o	JWT stored securely in memory or HttpOnly cookie (demo setup)
________________________________________
How to proceed:
1.	I’ll generate the full code files with explanations and local run commands.
2.	You can copy-paste or download and start developing immediately.
3.	You can push the code to your GitHub repo as you progress.
